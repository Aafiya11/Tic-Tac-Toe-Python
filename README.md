Creating a Python program for a two-player Tic Tac Toe game. The game should be played on a 3x3 grid where two players take turns to mark their symbol (X or O) in empty cells.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled, and there is no winner, the game ends 
in a draw.
